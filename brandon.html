        <p>
            I'm always interested in learning new skills and discovering how different things work. Currently, I'm also
            working on mathematics research involving game theory, which has allowed me to keep my brain constantly
            active while also combining my love for math and programming. Overall, I find a need to keep myself
            constantly busy and involved, whether that be with work, school, or some sort of game.
