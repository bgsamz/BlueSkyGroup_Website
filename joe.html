        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Object Oriented Programming – Largely all the software I have developed has been written in this
                architecture. Primarily using languages such as C and Java
            </li>
            <li>
                Mobile Applications – I have undertaken two major Mobile Application projects during my time at NAU and
                have become proficient with Android Studio.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multi – Threaded Programming – I have some experience creating multi-threaded programs and look forward
                to gaining more in the coming semesters
            </li>
            <li>
                Database Functional Web Forums – In almost all of the major software projects I have completed Web
                Forums and their corresponding databases have played a role.
            </li>
            <li>
                Technical Writing -  Since taking the required technical writing course I strive to create professional
                documents using appropriate design elements.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other interests</h3>
        <p>
            Outside of my academic life I have always had a passion for creating art and music. I believe this
            experience affects the way I approach programming in that I strive for a creative resolution to each
            problem. I believe this background also drives me to maintain a standard of presentability in my work.
            However, technology has been a long time passion of mine and the prospect of entering this community is
            thrilling.
